# FIFA Audience Analysis Dashboard

## Motivation
This dashboard is designed for sports marketing analysts, broadcasters, and decision-makers who need to understand global viewership patterns during the FIFA World Cup. By exploring the relationship between population share and TV audience share, users can identify trends, outliers, and opportunities for targeted marketing and broadcasting strategies.

## App Description
The app is built using Shiny in R and provides interactive tools to explore the FIFA audience dataset. Users can:
- Filter the data by confederation (e.g., UEFA, CONMEBOL, CAF) or select "All" to include all confederations.
- Adjust the population share and TV audience share ranges to focus on specific countries.
- Explore the relationship between population share and TV audience share in an interactive scatter plot.
- View the filtered data in an interactive table and access summary statistics.
